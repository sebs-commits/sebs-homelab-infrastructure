# sebs-homelab-infrastructure
This repository contains the IAC for my current homelab. This is currently a heavy on going project. 

I plan on using terrform for provisioning my VM's and LXC's on proxmox, and Ansible for configuring those VM's and LXC's. I also intend on learning and using this repository as a source for a future CI/CD pipeline.

## Architecture
**Terraform**: Creates VMs and LXCs on my proxmox cluster
**Ansible**: Configure VMs and LXCs and deploys docker services
